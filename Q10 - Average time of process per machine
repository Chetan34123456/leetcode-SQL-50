Title : Average time of process per machine
Description : 
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Answer : 
select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time 
from activity as a1
join activity as a2
on a1.process_id = a2.process_id and
    a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
    and a1.timestamp < a2.timestamp
group by a1.machine_id;
